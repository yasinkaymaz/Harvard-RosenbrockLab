## Clustering analysis of all cells in the Hook 2018 study

In each of these plots, colored dots represent individual cells. Analysis was done using only highly variable genes. Cell annotation are projected from original publication.


Three brain regions cells are taken from: 

**midbrain, MB**; 
**forebrain, FB**; 
**olfactory bulb, OB**;

**In the analysis, I excluded E15.5 cells as requested by CNSDR and done the rest of analysis with only P7 mice cells.**


### **PCA plots**

#### Cells are colored by mouse brain region, and cell subsets, respectively.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}

PCAPlot(object = Hook2018gene, group.by="region", pt.size=2)
PCAPlot(object = Hook2018gene, group.by="subset", pt.size=2)
```


### **UMAP plots**

#### Cells are colored by mouse brain region, and cell subsets, respectively.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
DimPlot(Hook2018gene, reduction.use = "umap", group.by = "region", pt.size=2)
DimPlot(Hook2018gene, reduction.use = "umap", group.by = "subset", pt.size=2)
```
