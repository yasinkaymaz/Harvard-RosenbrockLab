## Clustering analysis of all cells in the Hook 2018 study

In each of these plots, colored dots represent individual cells. Analysis was done using only highly variable genes. Cell annotation are projected from original publication.


Three brain regions cells are taken from: 

**midbrain, MB**; 
**forebrain, FB**; 
**olfactory bulb, OB**;

### **PCA plots**

#### Cells are colored by mouse age, brain region, and cell subsets, respectively.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}

PCAPlot(object = Hook2018,group.by="age",pt.size=2)
PCAPlot(object = Hook2018,group.by="region",pt.size=2)
PCAPlot(object = Hook2018,group.by="subset",pt.size=2)
```


### **tSNE plots**

#### Cells are colored by mouse age, brain region, and cell subsets, respectively.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
TSNEPlot(object = Hook2018,group.by="age",pt.size=2)
TSNEPlot(object = Hook2018,group.by="region",pt.size=2)
TSNEPlot(object = Hook2018,group.by="subset",pt.size=2)
```
